# Carbon_reduction_diary——An environmental protection software
This project combines the theoretical knowledge of complex networks to establish a "carbon network" and develop a personal carbon account software "Carbon Reduction Diary", which mainly includes the following research contents:

1.Establishment of personal carbon account database：
collect user and carbon emission information and establish user database, emission reduction behavior database and carbon emission database to provide data support for quantitative research on the value of carbon reduction behavior

2.Research on algorithm model for personal carbon account：
using AHP hierarchy method and pecking order diagram method and other weight calculation methods, the calculation weight of each module is reasonably set, and the user points are updated in real time through the points ranking array model. Finally, a green carbon reduction points ranking list with real-time ranking update is established.

3.Personal carbon account software development and design：
Using JavaScript and mysql to develop this carbon reduction program, the interactive functions involved in it are: "sign in", "answer questions", "get small water droplets", "raise trees", "upload carbon footprint", "calculate carbon emissions", "calculate ranking", "get medals" and other interesting functions
